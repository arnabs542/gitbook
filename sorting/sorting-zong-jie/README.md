# sorting 总结

### Terminology：

#### in-place sorting:

use constant extra space to sort the input. 

insertion sort 和 selection sort 是in place sort。

**Internal and External Sorting:**

when all data is placed in-memory, then sorting is called internal. 

when all data can not fit into the in-memory at a time. We use external sorting like merge sort to sort this massive amount of data. 



**Stability in sorting:**

a stable sorting is two object with equal key appear in the same order in output as in the input. 

stable sorting algorithm: bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, count sort, etc.
