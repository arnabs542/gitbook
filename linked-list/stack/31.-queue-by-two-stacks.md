# 31. Queue By Two Stacks



Java: Implement a queue by using two stacks. The queue should provide size\(\), isEmpty\(\), offer\(\), poll\(\) and peek\(\) operations. When the queue is empty, poll\(\) and peek\(\) should return null.

C++: Implement a queue by using two stacks. The queue should provide size\(\), isEmpty\(\), push\(\), front\(\) and pop\(\) operations. When the queue is empty, front\(\) should return -1.

**Assumptions**

* The elements in the queue are all Integers.
* size\(\) should return the number of elements buffered in the queue.
* isEmpty\(\) should return true if there is no element buffered in the queue, false otherwise.
