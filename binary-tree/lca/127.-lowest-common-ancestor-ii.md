# 127. Lowest Common Ancestor II

Given two nodes in a binary tree \(with parent pointer available\), find their lowest common ancestor.

**Assumptions**

* There is **parent** pointer for the nodes in the binary tree
* The given two nodes are not guaranteed to be in the binary tree

**Examples**

        5

      /   \

     9     12

   /  \      \

  2    3      14

The lowest common ancestor of 2 and 14 is 5

The lowest common ancestor of 2 and 9 is 9

The lowest common ancestor of 2 and 8 is null \(8 is not in the tree\)

### 思路

有parent pointer， node a和b 不一定都在tree里。

有parent pointer 让我们可以回头看，

选个node，如a， 把a的所有parent都存到set里

再从b一步一步往上走，看当前值是否存在于a的parent set。 如果是，return 当前node

```java
public class Solution {
  public TreeNodeP lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNodeP one, TreeNodeP two) {
    // Write your solution here.
    Set<TreeNodeP> set = new HashSet<>();
    while(one != null){
      set.add(one);
      one = one.parent;
    }
    while(two != null){
      if(set.contains(two)){
        return two;
      }
      two = two.parent;
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```
