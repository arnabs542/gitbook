# 67. Top K Frequent Words



Given a composition with different kinds of words, return a list of the top K most frequent words in the composition.

**Assumptions**

* the composition is not null and is not guaranteed to be sorted
* K &gt;= 1 and K could be larger than the number of distinct words in the composition, in this case, just return all the distinct words

**Return**

* a list of words ordered from most frequent one to least frequent one \(the list could be of size K or smaller than K\)

**Examples**

* Composition = \["a", "a", "b", "b", "b", "b", "c", "c", "c", "d"\], top 2 frequent words are \[“b”, “c”\]
* Composition = \["a", "a", "b", "b", "b", "b", "c", "c", "c", "d"\], top 4 frequent words are \[“b”, “c”, "a", "d"\]
* Composition = \["a", "a", "b", "b", "b", "b", "c", "c", "c", "d"\], top 5 frequent words are \[“b”, “c”, "a", "d"\]

### 题意：

给你一个array of characters， return top k 个由高到低出现频率的 character。 

### 思路:

a a b b b b c c c d     k = 2     return b c 

可以通过hashmap 来存每个element 和它出现的频率。 

再通过minheap 来main the top k frequent char by comparing the minheap.top  to the current element's frequent. 

这里minheap 里存hashmap里的entry， override compartor 去compare 2个entry的value\(也就是element的frequency）
