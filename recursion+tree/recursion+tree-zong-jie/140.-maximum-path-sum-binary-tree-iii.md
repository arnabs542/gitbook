# 140. Maximum Path Sum Binary Tree III

Given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer number. Find the maximum possible subpath sum**\(both the starting and ending node of the subpath should be on the same path from root to one of the leaf nodes, and the subpath is allowed to contain only one node\).**

**Assumptions**

* The root of given binary tree is not null

**Examples**

   -5

  /    \

2      11

     /    \

    6     14

           /

        -3

The maximum path sum is 11 + 14 = 25
