# 267. Search In Sorted Matrix I

Given a 2D matrix that contains integers only, which each row is sorted in an ascending order. The first element of next row is larger than \(or equal to\) the last element of previous row.

Given a target number, returning the position that the target locates within the matrix. If the target number does not exist in the matrix, return {-1, -1}.

**Assumptions:**

* The given matrix is not null, and has size of N \* M, where N &gt;= 0 and M &gt;= 0. 

**Examples:**

matrix = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 7}, {8, 9, 10} }

target = 7, return {1, 2}

target = 6, return {-1, -1} to represent the target number does not exist in the matrix.\

### 思路：

high level: treat the sorted matrix as a deserialized array. do binary search on this array to find the target. 

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)

we can deserialize the matrix think the matrix as \[0 to m \* n\] array.  
if index represents the index of the element on the array we can map this index to the matrix by index/col to get the row of the element, index% col to get the col of the element.

Since we figured out the way to map array index to the matrix, all we left to do is binary search.

Time complexity : O\(log\(m\*_n\)\) we do a binary search on this m_ n array. Space: O\(1\) we did not actually construct an array for the binary search 

### code：

```java
public class Solution {
  public int[] search(int[][] matrix, int target) {
    // Write your solution here
    if(matrix == null || matrix.length == 0 || matrix[0].length == 0){
      return new int[]{-1,-1};
    }
    int row = matrix.length;
    int col = matrix[0].length;
    int n = row * col;
    int left = 0;
    int right = n - 1;
    while(left <= right) {
      int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
      int midRow = mid / col;
      int midCol = mid % col;
      if(matrix[midRow][midCol] == target){
        return new int[]{midRow, midCol};
      }else if (matrix[midRow][midCol] < target){
        left = mid + 1;
      }else{
        right = mid - 1;
      }
    }
    return new int[]{-1,-1};

  }
}
```
